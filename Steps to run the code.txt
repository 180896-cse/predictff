Steps to run the code:
----------------------

1. Unzip the code in a folder

2. Install requisite packages
	pip install -r requirements.txt

3. From the shell/command prompt go to that directory
	cd <directory path>

4. Install virtualenv
	pip install virtualenv

5. Create the virtual environment
	virtualenv env

6. Activate the Virtual environment
	env\Scripts\activate

7. Run the streamlit app
	streamlit run app.py

8. Open the browser and go to URL
	 Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  	 Network URL: http://192.168.1.5:8501





NOTE : If you get an error "...toml.decoder...", 


I also got the same error while I tried to run the 'streamlit' command.

So, what I did is track in the code entirely to see from where I can find this 'config.toml' and simply deleted the file.

The path for 'config.toml' file in Windows is: C:users/{username}/.streamlit/config.toml

Delete this file and it will solve the error.
